## 🎨 Custom Fonts? Here's the Trick:
Markdown on GitHub doesn’t support custom fonts directly. But you can:
- Use **images** for headers made in your favorite font (upload or link from an image host).
- Or use GitHub Actions to render text in a custom style and auto-update it.

Need help doing that? I can set it up for you.
